# tetris
Tetris game made with Java Swing. This was my APCS semester 2 final project (late upload by about 7 months). The game implements most functionalities of standard tetris and comes in 4 difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, adaptive) with scoring systems. However, the game does not model some functionalities of modern tetris, such as T-spins.
